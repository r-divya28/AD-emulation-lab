# Password Policy Review

## Overview

Passwords were evaluated from a defensive perspective.

The policy meets minimum compliance standards.



## Observed Weaknesses

While functional, the policy:

- Allows short passwords  
- Uses predictable expiry  
- Lacks complexity enforcement  



## Enterprise Threat Model

Modern attacks operate at scale.

Short passwords enable:

- Brute force attacks  
- Credential stuffing  
- Offline dictionary attacks  



## Recommendation

Improve policy by:

- Increasing minimum length  
- Enabling complexity  
- Auditing password reuse  
- Enforcing admin MFA
